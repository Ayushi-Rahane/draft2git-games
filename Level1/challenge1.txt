ðŸ§© Level 1 â€” The Forgotten Password

Deep inside this file, someone left an old password hint. But it's encrypted...

Your task:
1. Create a file in the root directory named `proof1.txt`
2. Write this exact message in it:
   "The forgotten password is found."
3. Stage and commit it with the message: I am ready

Once done, push your commit â€” and see what happens.
